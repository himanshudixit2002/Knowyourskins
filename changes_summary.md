# Chatbot Response Style Changes

## Overview
We've modified the chatbot's response generation system to make it sound more conversational and human-like, rather than clinical and professional.

## Before and After Example

**Original Clinical Response:**
```
Dry, flaky skin is typically caused by a compromised skin barrier. It is recommended to incorporate a hydrating serum with hyaluronic acid, followed by a moisturizer with ceramides. Gentle cleansing is essential to avoid further irritation. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream is an effective option due to its ceramide content. Application of this regimen both morning and night should yield optimal results within approximately two weeks. Further evaluation by a dermatologist is recommended if symptoms persist or worsen.
```

**New Conversational Response:**
```
I know how annoying that can be. Dry, flaky skin is usually because of a compromised skin barrier. I'd suggest you add in a hydrating serum with hyaluronic acid, followed by a moisturizer with ceramides. Gentle cleansing really helps avoid further irritation. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream is a great choice because it has ceramide content. Using this routine both morning and night should help a lot within about two weeks. You've got this! Seeing a dermatologist might be a good idea if it doesn't get better.
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Added Empathetic Openings**: Based on sentiment analysis of the user's question, we now start responses with empathetic acknowledgments like "I totally get it" or "I know how annoying that can be".

2. **Clinical to Casual Language Conversion**: We replaced formal medical terms with conversational equivalents:
   - "It is recommended to" → "I'd suggest you"
   - "Application of" → "Using"
   - "Effective option" → "Great choice"
   - "Approximately" → "About"

3. **Added Contractions**: We replaced formal constructions with contractions to sound more natural:
   - "It is" → "It's"
   - "That is" → "That's"
   - "Cannot" → "Can't"

4. **Personal Pronouns**: Added direct address using "you" and "your" instead of impersonal language:
   - "The skin" → "Your skin"
   - "One's skin" → "Your skin"

5. **Encouraging Phrases**: Added supportive statements like "You've got this!" and "Hope that helps!"

6. **Removed Overly Formal Tone**: Preserved friendly endings instead of removing them, and kept exclamation marks for enthusiasm.
