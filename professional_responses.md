# Professional Chatbot Response Style

## Overview
We've modified the chatbot's response generation system to make it sound more professional, direct, and informative rather than overly casual or conversational.

## Before and After Example

**Original Casual Response:**
```
Oh honey, dry, flaky skin is so frustrating! It sounds really uncomfortable. The key is gentle hydration and barrier repair. Try switching to a creamy cleanser, like CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser, followed by a rich moisturizer such as La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer. Avoid harsh scrubs. Focus on gentle hydration throughout the day. You'll see a difference! Remember, consistency is key – give it a few weeks to see improvement Hope that helps! . You've got this! Further assessment by a dermatologist may be indicated for annoying symptoms.
```

**New Professional Response:**
```
This condition is treatable. Dry, flaky skin is uncomfortable. The key is gentle hydration and barrier repair. Try switching to a creamy cleanser, like CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser, followed by a rich moisturizer such as La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer. Avoid harsh scrubs. Focus on gentle hydration throughout the day. You'll see a difference. Consistency is important – give it a few weeks to see improvement.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed Overly Casual Language**: Eliminated phrases like "Oh honey" and unnecessary enthusiastic expressions.

2. **Replaced Casual Phrases with Professional Alternatives**:
   - "so frustrating" → "uncomfortable"
   - "really helps" → "helps"
   - "You've got this!" → removed
   - "Hope that helps!" → removed

3. **Substituted Direct Language with Professional Terminology**:
   - "try adding" → "incorporate"
   - "about" → "approximately"
   - "Using this routine" → "Following this regimen"
   - "seeing a dermatologist might be a good idea" → "consulting with a dermatologist is recommended"

4. **Added Professional Openings**: Added clinical openings based on identified sentiment:
   - "This condition is treatable."
   - "Your symptoms are common."
   - "These symptoms can be addressed."

5. **Eliminated Redundancies**: Removed repeated expressions of the same sentiment or information.

6. **Improved Sentence Structure**: Ensured proper capitalization and punctuation, with clean sentence breaks.

7. **Removed Exclamation Points**: Replaced exclamation points with periods for a more professional tone.
