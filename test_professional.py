Try switching to a creamy cleanser, like CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser, followed by a rich moisturizer such as La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer. Avoid harsh scrubs. Focus on gentle hydration throughout the day. You'll see a difference! Remember, consistency is key â€“ give it a few weeks to see improvement Hope that helps! . You've got this! Further assessment by a dermatologist may be indicated for annoying symptoms."
